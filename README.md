# PopCluster
PopCluster: a new algorithm to identify genetic variants with ethnicity-dependent effects

To submit the job, run the following shell script that links all the files and scripts:

*sh PopCluster.sh workdir scriptsdir filesdir eigensoftdir*

* workdir: where the PopCluster.sh is located and where you want results to be stored.
* scriptsdir: scripts-dir folder
* filesdir: files-dir folder
* eigensoftdir: eigensoft-dir folder

All the directories should end in "/", for example: "/restricted/projectnb/necs/Nastia-Analysis/clustering-procedure/"

**scripts-dir** folder contains R scripts
